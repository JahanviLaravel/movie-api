I tried to push my changes to Docker Hub, however it was taking forever from CLI and also from Docker Desktop. Hence I have uploaded my work here on git hub.
I have used mysql as backend hence the .env settings reflect to it.
Please run 'sail artisan migrate' and 'sail migrate db:seed' to get the database changes.
